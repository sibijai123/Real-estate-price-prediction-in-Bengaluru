# Real-estate-price-prediction-in-Bengaluru
Original Dataset: Dataset is downloaded from here: https://www.kaggle.com/amitabhajoy/bengaluru-house-price-data

Note: Almost all of the code belong to Codebasics and Dhaval Patel.This is not my own creation.This project was made just for studying purpose so that I get a hands-on experience and to get an intution on how data science and machine learning is used in real world.

Youtube Link: Mr.Dhaval Patel takes you through a fantastic journey of building a real estate prediction model in bengaluru using previous labeled data found in Kaggle. I have attached the link to the first video of the playlist. The subsequent videos can be found in the description. People interseted in Web development can also know how a model can be deployed in a website.

#Goal
Our goal is to develop an optimal supervised machine learning model which can predict the real estate price when some features like location, bedroom size, bathroom size is provided. Previous labeled data is attached in the repository. You can use it to make the model.
